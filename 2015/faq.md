January 6, 2015 at 3:18am

##### Where can I register for the Hacker Cup?  https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/register
##### Who gets T-shirts?
 
   The top 550 finishers from Round 2 will get t-shirts.
    
##### How many people advance?
     
- Qualification round: Everyone who gets at least one problem right will advance to Round 1.
- Round 1: The top 500 finishers will advance to Round 2. Everyone that gets the same number of points as the person in 500th place will also advance to Round 2.
- Round 2: The top 100 finishers will advance to Round 3.
- Round 3: The top 25 finishers will advance to the onsite final.

##### How is the time penalty calculated?
      
   The time penalty is the sum of the submission times for all of the problems that you get correct. So if you submit a problem 10 minutes into the contest and get it right, then submit a problem 30 minutes later (40 minutes into the contest) and get it right, your time penalty will be 50 minutes.
         
##### How many problems do I need to get correct to advance in the qualification round?
          
   Getting one or more problems correct will qualify you to compete in round 1.
             
##### When will I know whether my answers were right?
              
   We will judge the submissions after the round has ended.

##### How do I compete?
                      
1. Before the competition starts, we'll post a link that you can use to access the problems for that round.
2. Write a program to solve the problem. You can use any programming language that has a free compiler or interpreter available. Your program will need to solve the input file in less than 6 minutes.
3. Make sure that your program exactly follows the input and output formats. When you run your program on the sample input, it should produce the sample output.
4. When you are confident that your program is correct, download the input file. This will start a 6-minute timer. You must upload your output and your source code before the timer ends to get credit for the problem.
5. If you accidentally submit the wrong files or you realize that there is a problem with your program, you can resubmit as many times as you need to during the 6 minutes. Once the 6 minutes has ended, you may not submit again for that problem. The last submission within the 6 minutes will be used for grading.
6. After the round has ended, we'll judge the problems. If you advance to the next round you'll be notified via email.
