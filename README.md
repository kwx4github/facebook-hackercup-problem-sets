# facebook-hackercup-problem-sets
This repo meant to be a repository collecting all (or as many as possible) the problem set, solutions and perhaps also the source code written by others in the facebook hacker cup in the hope that it would be useful for others to use them for practice and prepare for the future coding contests.
